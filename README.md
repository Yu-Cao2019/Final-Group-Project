## Code
This folder includs nine file -- 'eda-plant-pathology-2021.ipynb', 'failed-ensemble.ipynb', 'model-conbination.ipynb', 'model-plant-pathology-2021.ipynb', 'new-eda.ipynb', 'resnet.ipynb', 'ressub.ipynb', 'val-aug.ipynb' and 'vgg-v1.ipynb'.  
*Note*: Because the dataset is too large, we didn't download it and just wrote code in kaggle and run them. So, if you want to run our code, maybe you can use 'kaggle competitions download -c plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8' to download the dataset.  
If you want to execute this code, please follow this process:
```
eda-plant-pathology-2021.ipynb
new-eda.ipynb
```
These two are used to data expansion. The first is the version of pixel+spatial transform and the second is the only spatial level transform.After downloading the data from kaggle, you can execute these two first.

## Final Group Presentation

## Individual Final Report
This folder includs two folders, named by the name of our team members.  
Each folder has two folders in it -- 'Code' and 'Individual-Final-Project-Report-_team member's name_'.  
We upload our own work both code and project report parts into corresponding folder.  
There also is a 'README.md' file in our own code part to guide readers.
